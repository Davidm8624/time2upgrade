                <p>People always refer to us as a lesser species, I then decided to become a drug dealer and slowly ruin
                    the human race untill I can take over. My device wasn't able to handle my blackmarket mass purchases
                    though. This ram was an indespenciable tool</p>

                <p>After forcing my cyborgs to be a free workforce I decided that I should reward them. I gave them the
                    ability to reproduce, but you see, their children needed a better cooling system. Cyborgs are still
                    a government secret so I couldn't buy anything in a store. Your amazing download helped makes those
                    children... cooler</p>

                <p>Birds arent real! the govenrment spys on us every time we leave out house. Our old commodore 64 from
                    1982 still had an Cathode-ray tube based screen. This amazing curved monitor was a great invesntment
                    and saved us from going outside.</p>
