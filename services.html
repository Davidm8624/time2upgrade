            <h3 class="title">60Fps</h3>
            <p class="description">Did you know that Windows is acually scamming you? Thats right, they set a governor cap on your frames. Then they make it flucuate a little to make you think your seeing live frame stats. Acually though its all an illusion! All computers acually have a minimum of 90 frames per second. With the cap though you can only get your 40 fps. With our hightech methods we can increse it by 60 fps per download. This tech is so advanced that if we let you download and more then 60 fps the governor will see it as a threat. So disregard that virus warning message, its acually windows trying to limit your future, and your dreams. Come back for more downloads and download more frames (max of 400 before overheat, deteriorate this further with out cooling system download!) </p>
