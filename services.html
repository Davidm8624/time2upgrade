                from the first moon landing when Neil Armstrong was streaming to all his "cosmic sensations" onlyfans
                premium group back at nasa, and even all the criminals in Alcatraz where they have the chrome and platinum
                insulated walls to stop all communication... we can beat even that. Its no secret any more people, get
                what people have been hiding from you for years. Get wifi anywhere you go!</p>

            <h3 class="title">60Fps</h3>
            <p class="description">Did you know that Windows is acually scamming you? Thats right, they set a governor
                cap on your frames. Then they make it flucuate a little to make you think your seeing live frame stats.
                Actually though its all an illusion! All computers actually have a minimum of 90 frames per second. With
                the cap though you can only get your 40 fps. With our hightech methods we can increse it by 60 fps per
                download. This tech is so advanced that if we let you download and more then 60 fps the governor will
                see it as a threat. So disregard that virus warning message, its acually windows trying to limit your
                future, and your dreams. Come back for more downloads and download more frames (max of 400 before
                overheat, deteriorate this further with out cooling system download!) </p>
